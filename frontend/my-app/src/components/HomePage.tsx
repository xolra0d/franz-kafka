      <Title>Franz Kafka</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Franz Kafka (born July 3, 1883, Prague, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now in
        Czech Republic]—died June 3, 1924, Kierling, near Vienna, Austria) was a
        German-language writer of visionary fiction whose works—especially the
        novel Der Prozess (1925; The Trial) and the story Die Verwandlung (1915;
        The Metamorphosis)—express the anxieties and alienation felt by many in
        20th-century Europe and North America.

      <Title>Life</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Franz Kafka, the son of Julie Löwy and Hermann Kafka, a merchant, was
        born into a prosperous middle-class Jewish family. After two brothers
        died in infancy, he became the eldest child and remained, for the rest
        of his life, conscious of his role as elder brother; Ottla, the youngest
        of his three sisters, became the family member closest to him. Kafka
        strongly identified with his maternal ancestors because of their
        spirituality, intellectual distinction, piety, rabbinical learning,
        melancholy disposition, and delicate physical and mental constitution.
        He was not, however, particularly close to his mother. Subservient to
        her overwhelming ill-tempered husband and his exacting business, she
        shared with her spouse a lack of comprehension of their son’s
        unprofitable and, they feared, unhealthy dedication to the literary
        “recording of [his]…dreamlike inner life.”
      </Paragraph>

      <Title>Kafka and his father</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The figure of Kafka’s father overshadowed his work as well as his
        existence. The figure is, in fact, one of his most impressive creations.
        In his imagination this coarse, practical, and domineering shopkeeper
        and patriarch who worshipped nothing but material success and social
        advancement belonged to a race of giants and was an awesome, admirable,
        but repulsive tyrant. In Kafka’s most important attempt at
        autobiography, Brief an den Vater (written 1919; Letter to Father), a
        letter that never reached the addressee, Kafka attributed his failure to
        live, to cut loose from parental ties and establish himself in marriage
        and fatherhood, as well as his escape into literature, to the
        prohibitive father figure, which instilled in him the sense of his own
        impotence. He felt his will had been broken by his father. The conflict
        with the father is reflected directly in Kafka’s story Das Urteil (1913;
        The Judgment). It is projected on a grander scale in Kafka’s novels,
        which portray in lucid, deceptively simple prose a man’s desperate
        struggle with an overwhelming power, one that may persecute its victim
        (as in The Trial) or one that may be sought after and begged in vain for
        approval (as in Das Schloss [1926; The Castle]). Yet the roots of
        Kafka’s anxiety and despair go deeper than his relationship with his
        father and family, with whom he chose to live in close and cramped
        proximity for the major part of his adult life. The source of Kafka’s
        despair lies in a sense of ultimate isolation from true communion with
        all human beings—the friends he cherished, the women he loved, the job
        he detested, the society he lived in—and with God, or, as he put it,
        with true indestructible Being.

      <Paragraph>
        The son of an assimilated Jew who held only perfunctorily to the
        religious practices and social formalities of the Jewish community,
        Kafka was German in both language and culture. He was a timid,
        guilt-ridden, and obedient child who did well in elementary school and
        in the Altstädter Staatsgymnasium, an exacting high school for the
        academic elite. He was respected and liked by his teachers. Inwardly,
        however, he rebelled against the authoritarian institution and the
        dehumanized humanistic curriculum, with its emphasis on rote learning
        and classical languages. Kafka’s opposition to established society
        became apparent when, as an adolescent, he declared himself a socialist
        as well as an atheist. Throughout his adult life he expressed qualified
        sympathies for the socialists, he attended meetings of Czech anarchists
        (before World War I), and in his later years he showed marked interest
        and sympathy for a socialized Zionism. Even then he was essentially
        passive and politically unengaged. As a Jew, Kafka was isolated from the
        German community in Prague, but, as a modern intellectual, he was also
        alienated from his own Jewish heritage. He was sympathetic to Czech
        political and cultural aspirations, but his identification with German
        culture kept even these sympathies subdued. Thus, social isolation and
        rootlessness contributed to Kafka’s lifelong personal unhappiness.

      <Title>Kafka’s double life</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Kafka did, however, become friendly with some German Jewish
        intellectuals and literati in Prague, and in 1902 he met Max Brod. This
        minor literary artist became the most intimate and solicitous of Kafka’s
        friends, and eventually, as Kafka’s literary executor, he emerged as the
        promoter, saviour, and interpreter of Kafka’s writings and as his most
        influential biographer. The two men became acquainted while Kafka was
        studying law at the University of Prague. He received his doctorate in
        1906, and in 1907 he took up regular employment with an insurance
        company. The long hours and exacting requirements of the Assicurazioni
        Generali, however, did not permit Kafka to devote himself to writing. In
        1908 he found in Prague a job in the seminationalized Workers’ Accident
        Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. There he remained until
        1917, when tuberculosis forced him to take intermittent sick leaves and,
        finally, to retire (with a pension) in 1922, about two years before he
        died. In his job he was considered tireless and ambitious; he soon
        became the right hand of his boss, and he was esteemed and liked by all
        who worked with him.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In fact, generally speaking, Kafka was a charming, intelligent, and
        humorous individual, but he found his routine office job and the
        exhausting double life into which it forced him (for his nights were
        frequently consumed in writing) to be excruciating torture, and his
        deeper personal relationships were neurotically disturbed. The
        conflicting inclinations of his complex and ambivalent personality found
        expression in his sexual relationships. Inhibition painfully disturbed
        his relations with Felice Bauer, to whom he was twice engaged before
        their final rupture in 1917. Later his love for Milena Jesenská Pollak
        was also thwarted. His health was poor and office work exhausted him. In
        1917 he was diagnosed as having tuberculosis, and from then onward he
        spent frequent periods in sanatoriums.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In 1923 Kafka went to Berlin to devote himself to writing. During a
        vacation on the Baltic coast later that year, he met Dora Dymant
        (Diamant), a young Jewish socialist. The couple lived in Berlin until
        Kafka’s health significantly worsened during the spring of 1924. After a
        brief final stay in Prague, where Dymant joined him, he died of
        tuberculosis in a clinic near Vienna.
